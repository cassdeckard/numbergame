# numbergame
A simple number identification game for a target audience of young children
(preschool and kindergartener age)

## Installation
This is an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) app based on the
[angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/) project. For a more
detailed installation guide, see the angular-seed README.

To install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the application:
```
npm start
```

## The game
When the page loads, large buttons with numbers will appear and a voice will
say one of the numbers. The goal is to press the button with the number you
hear.

If you need to hear the goal number again, press the button at the top of the
page with question marks on it.

Once the correct answer is chosen, a celebratory sound will play, and the screen
will refresh with a new challenge.
